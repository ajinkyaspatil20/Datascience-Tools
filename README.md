Below is a structured summary of key data science algorithms and techniques I’ve implemented through hands-on projects, emphasizing their core purpose and application areas:

| 🧠 Algorithm / Tool         | 💡 Description                                                                 | 🔍 Common Applications                             |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**      | Predicts continuous values by modeling linear relationships.                   | Sales forecasting, pricing models                  |
| **Logistic Regression**    | Estimates binary outcomes using a logistic function.                          | Classification (spam, fraud detection)             |
| **Decision Tree**          | Splits data based on features for classification/regression.                  | Risk assessment, medical diagnosis                 |
| **Random Forest**          | Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.                         | Credit scoring, customer churn prediction          |
| **AdaBoost**               | Boosting technique that focuses on hard-to-classify instances.                | Fraud detection, ensemble learning tasks           |
| **Support Vector Machine** | Finds optimal hyperplanes for classification.                                 | Text categorization, image recognition             |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**    | Classifies data based on proximity to neighbors.                              | Pattern recognition, recommendation systems        |
| **K-Means Clustering**     | Groups data into K distinct clusters based on similarity.                     | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection           |
| **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | Reduces dimensionality while retaining data variance.              | Feature reduction, data visualization              |
| **Naive Bayes**            | Probabilistic model assuming feature independence.                            | Text classification, sentiment analysis            |
