🛠️ Data Science Tools & Algorithms
Linear Regression – Used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Decision Tree – A tree-like model used for classification and regression by splitting data based on feature values.

Random Forest – An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results for better accuracy

AdaBoost – A boosting algorithm that combines weak learners to create a strong classifier by focusing on misclassified instances.

Logistic Regression – Used for binary classification tasks by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on the majority vote of its neighbors.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – A supervised model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

K-Means Clustering – An unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features into uncorrelated components.

Naive Bayes – A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of feature independence.
